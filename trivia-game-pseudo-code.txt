1. Create a var containing question and answers as array. 
Each array element is an object -- for every question -- with property "question" and property "answers" as an array of objects -- one object for every answer {answer: xxxxxx, value: true/false}.

Create variables:
correctAnsCount - contains the number of correct answers
wrongAnsCount - contains the number of wrong answers
noAnsCount - contains the number of questions without answer

Create radio buttons for every answer. On button group for each question.

2. Create a function returning the number of selected answer (for each question).

Create the "Start" button.

Create a timer:
-start by clicking "Start" button.
-30 sec delay

Create a function which evaluates the value (true of false) of chosen answers. 
if answer there is an answer {
if answer is true {correctAnsCount++
} else {wrongAnsCount++}
} else {noAnsCount++}


Function evalAns() called after the timer stop.
